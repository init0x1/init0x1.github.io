Hello, today I will discuss a `OTP Verification Bypass ` bug I discovered within my target.

## Starting with simple recon
I started by performing a basic recon for the target and i found  out that there is subdomain 'dev.target.com,' serving as the development environment for the website, housing its isolated database.

so i start to create an account on it with  the same credentials intended for the production environment.


```json
"email" : "init0x1@me.com"
"phone" : "+12345678910"
```
The website generated an `OTP-TOKEN` and Send an SMS containing the OTP to the specified phone number.


### I relayed this request to a repeater to facilitate its utilization in creating an account within the production environment.

after sending `1111` as an `otp`  , we can see that it is validated successfully and retern token to complate the process of ceating an account.

## Bypassing Verification in the Production Environment

###  with the same request i used in the development environment, I modified  the `OTP-TOKEN` before submission with the token i have and send the request and it return with the `token` that i use it to complate the process .

In summary, the key takeaway lies in the importance of conducting simple reconnaissance as a fundamental step in identifying potential vulnerabilities. By initiating a thorough investigation into what is discovered and actively testing the functionality encountered,Thank you for reading, and for more insights, you can follow me on Twitter: [@init0x1](https://twitter.com/init0x1).
